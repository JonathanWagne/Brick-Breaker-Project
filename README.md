# Brick-Breaker-Project

Hackathon Game Brick Braker

# To Do

- discuss game logic and desired functions
- discuss layout
- create a layout prototype with figma
- setup a development environment
- create comon git repository
- create field with figma
- decide if browser game (mobile first approach?) or as an app
- launch game with netlify

# Description

- try to clear a wall of bricks using a paddle and a ball. If the ball falls down beneath the paddle, the game is lost.

# Functions

- move the paddle with arrow keys
- ball breaks brick(s) after collision
- ball gets reflected on the walls
- ball bounces/gets reflected when hitting bricks
- ball gets reflected by the paddle
- (pitch the ball when it hits the corner of the paddle)
- unbreakable bricks for more difficulty
- if ball falls under the table disappear
- high score board
- sound when brick gets destroyed, game is lost or when paddle bounces ball
- background soundtrack
- (optional) action bricks, which gives additional or other colored balls
- arcade mode and random mode/endless mode
- animation when brick is destroyed
- paddle and ball animations (that it transitions smoothly)
- destructable bricks can take different amount of hits (have hitpoints)
- destructable bricks have different colours

- extra features
  - iron wall
  - plasma ball
  - multi balls
  - change paddle size

# Logic

- create walls and paddle
- create brick wall
- release ball with spacebar
- if all bricks are cleared, move to next level
- transform destroyed bricks into points
- if ball gets lost, game is lost
